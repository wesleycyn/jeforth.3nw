	I tried to add a jQuery-Terminal console for Yap/FigTaiwan's jeforth v1 
	on HTA environment. But turned out to find HTA is a sinking boat so I 
	am moving the bits to node-webkit. ----------- done!
	
	[x] how to gets() or readline() ?
	==> No way. I think that I need to put up with the event driven style.


hcchen5600 2013/08/31 11:34:59  r2

	I don't know how to deal with the event driven gets(). Let's do and
	see. Start to port my two words kernal. The two words are code and end-code.
	hcchen5600 2013/10/01 16:53:43 
	I can handle the event-driven keyboard input now! I split the gets() job 
	into two phases. Whether the rear phase can continue to finish the job is
	the key to success. My recent case is the docode() function, its rear phase
	is to execute the 'end-code' and that's do-able. Another important thing is
	that the call-back function is not as terrible as I thought. Call-back function
	can be defined *within* a mother function and the beautiful thing is that the
	mother function's variable is not volatile. Callback function can access
	them even after the mother function has ended!


hcchen5600 2013/10/03 00:40:10 r3

	jeforth03 is now very well. But term.echo() always prints a \n that's not what
	dot . command is expeting. I am asking the question at 
	https://github.com/jcubic/jquery.terminal/issues/124
	and I found a place to demo qestions : http://jsfiddle.net/eephillip/dEczJ/


hcchen5600 2013/10/03 11:26:43 r4

	(1) 
	The problem of echo() can be resolved by replacing echo by something like this,
	window.echobuffer ="";
	function myecho(){
		if (echobuffer){
			terminal.echo(echobuffer);
			echobuffer = ""
		}
		terminal.echo("OK ");
	}
	terminal.set_prompt(myecho);
	
	(2)
	jsc , accept , *debug* <---- shell also docode()
	When in such shells, the jeforth is still running !! <----- Problem, like in breakpoint is expected.
	jsc in interpreter or outer loop has been fixed by using the pasueExec flag. Going to work in inner 
	loop . . . . that will be r5


hcchen5600 2013/10/04 13:54:01 r5

	done !
	evernote:///view/2472143/s22/ab302a71-bb94-44d5-98d6-7b924befc16e/ab302a71-bb94-44d5-98d6-7b924befc16e/


hcchen5600 2013/10/05 10:36:51 r6

	Design suspendForthVM - resumeForthVM  ..... OK!
	Use suspend-resume and jQuery-terminal's term.push()-pop() have successfully 
	accomplished 'accept', '*debug*', 'jsc', and 'docode'.
	But I think if make suspend-resume forth words then a read-line colon word 
	would be even more interesting . . . that would be r7


hcchen5600 2013/10/06 17:01:51 r7

	I found a r6's problem when developing r7. See below example,

		j e f o r t h . n w -- r6
		OK : test 1 2 3 accept 4 5 6 ;
		OK : test2 11 22 33 test 44 55 66 ;
		OK test2
		> sdfsdff sfsfsdf
		OK .s
			0:         11          bh (number)
			1:         22         16h (number)
			2:         33         21h (number)
			3:          1          1h (number)
			4:          2          2h (number)
			5:          3          3h (number)
			6: sdfsdff sfsfsdf (string)
			7: true (boolean)
			8:          4          4h (number)
			9:          5          5h (number)
			a:          6          6h (number)
		OK  <---------- problem! 44 55 66 is missing. Because intter loop
						terminated by 'endinner' that is raied up by test's 'ret'.
						When resuming, outer() should let inner() know whether it's resuming.
						The inner() ignores endinner flag when resuming, because the deep inner 
						loop issue is impossible, . 

		r7 has fixed the problem already.
	
	[x] : test 1 2 3 unknown-word 4 5 6 ; <----- still create a new word !! Error handling is bad.
	[x] Can't abort 'accept' by Ctrl-D is not good. ==> Ctrl-D can clear the line.
	[/] Use suspend-resume has made 'accept' much smaller and more readable!
		Re-write jsc, *debug* <----------- let them be.
	[x] include
	[ ] selftest of all words, refer to 
	[ ] vocabulary
	[ ] WMI
	[ ] excel

hcchen5600 2013/10/07 10:35:57 r8

	Self-test study
	Now I've got an idea for self-test! Design two words <selftest> and </selftest>
	that collect the string within to the selftest string variable. Then fortheval(selftest) at
	the end! So we can use all words in the self-test sections, beautiful!

	code <selftest> ( <statements> -- ) \ Collect self test statements to selftest string
		var s = nexttoken("</selftest>");
		if (!s.flag) {
			do { 
				s += nextstring("</selftest>").str;
			} while(!s.flag);
		}
		push(s); 
		end-code
	code </selftest> ( "selftest" -- ) \ Save the self test statements to the global variable selftest.
		selftest = pop()
		end-code 
		
	[x] Why call-stack is so deep when including jeforth.f ?
		Because docode() calls outer() is very strange !!!
	[x] panic should print ntib first. How to avoid printing the entire huge tib? 
		print tib.substr(ntib, 80)
	[x] Use debugger; to write a breakpoint("prompt",conditon)
	[x] echobuffer is not dump! Move into prompt() doesn't fixed the problem.
		same problem : 'words' prints nothing now ???!!!! 
		==> Because the OK prompt was there before running the self-test section!
		    why? I guess, because the OK prompt is actually the first one of the 
			entire session. It was there at the beginning. The OK prompt we expect to
			print the echobuffer needs an enter from the keyboard.
		==> If use '\n' then ok. The auther thinks term.echo() should always have a '\n' at the end.
			and he has no idea about my echobuffer.
		==> So how about to print a '\n' after self-test?
	*** ==> root cause is, jeforth.f and self-test are all running in jQuery-termianl's
			onInit: section. Of course the prompt is not working yet. So an ending '\n'
			should be printed after includeing jeforth.f to flush the echobuffer.
		
	[x] calling outer(ip) in fortheval() is not so beautiful.
	[ ] words, help, don't use RegEx 
	[/] 'text' has bug. "char nop text nop" will still wait for input while it should return
		an empty string. <============ limitation

	
	self-test infrastructure is Ok, now r9 to go on developing the self-tests.
	
hcchen5600 2013/10/08 15:56:52 r9

	[x] why 'words' only prints some words? ---> that's "words cr" !! not a problem.

	[ ] docode's definition uses jQuery-terminal is not good. It causes a problem too, 
		*** execute :  "drop" should drop the TOS ... pass

r10
			... to the above problem,
		[x] my idea is to re-write code end-code to colon words. So in jeforth.js they
			assume tib is never end! This must be r10. ===> on going now ...
			==> r10 done but problem is still there. Root cause is not 'code', root cause
				is "term.set_prompt(prompt)" statement in ';'.

		[x] panic to be replaced by colon word, <---- no! 
			so as to wait for an user's response <----- separate Warnings and Errors
			or launch an alert("message") <--- no, alert() has only [ok]
			Reset() or not?  <------------ error jump into jsc, up to the user.
			Switch to jsc <------ errors
			close() the program <------- nothing is so bad
			switch to Chrome debugger <----- can do that in jsc 

		[ ] recall why these 3 must be separated in definition of 'alias' ??
			fortheval("BL"); execute("word (create)");
			
		[ ] term.echo() or systemtype() does not print immediately until a prompt.
			function (){ /* test6 */
				for(var i=0; i<100; i++) { systemtype(i+'\n'); fortheval("100 sleep"); }
			}
			so systemtype() should issue a prompt for '\n'.
			===> I am asking the author about this question.
			===> I also found  command_line.prompt(prompt); in J/T prints the "prompt".
			
		[ ] Unify the display output forth words to dot . and everything depend on it.
		[ ]	Kernel should not be I/O related at all ! Use no keyboard, print messages to
			startup.log instead.
		[ ] Separate 00_init.f 01_kernel.f 02_misc.f 03_jQueryTerminal.f etc

r11 
		[x] remove I/O related things out of jeforth.js and even jeforth.f. Basic I/O is in index.htm only.
		[x] I found a problem in older jeforth! 'alias' should not copy everyting by value.
			not arrays and not objects.
			but .creater should copy by value so as to add 'alias'
		[x] If we want && and || then we better do it right.
			&& ( a b == a && b ) if a then b else swap endif
			|| ( a b == a || b ) if a then swap else b endif
		[x] Hex is stragne in JavaScript, -1 & 0xffffffff will be still -1. That means hex is 32 bits
			and bit 31 is the sign bit. But not exactly, because 0xfff(over 32 bits) can be existing.
			However, my job is just to print hex correctly by using .r and .0r. So I simply use a 
			workaround that prings higher 16 bits and then lower 16 bits separatedly then JavaScript's
			opinion about hex won't bother anymore.
			
			n = (n >> 16 & 0xffff).toString(base) + (n & 0xffff).toString(base);
	
			JavaScript's decimal can be very big numbers. But hex is a little strange.
			For example, -2 >> 1 is -1 correct, -2 >> 31 is also -1 correct, but -2 >> 32 become -2 !!
			It seems like a 32 bits system when bitwise. So my .s only prints the lower 32 bits hex.
			
		[x] Self-test done Shooooo! But it won't be executed without a trigger. So jeforth.f is 
			started by jQuery-termianl.onInit. 
	
		[x] print('\n') doesn't do anything just like <js>  $.terminal.active().echo("") </js> either.
			But <js>  $.terminal.active().echo("\n") </js> and
			But <js>  $.terminal.active().echo(" \n") </js> both prints two blank lines.
			While print(" ") and print(" \n") both print one blank line only.
			===> fixed. Debug using Chrome debugger; console.log(), find the repro procedure first..
			     etc have helpped a lot. Don't forget to write down the notes, this is so important.

		[x] Now print() already down. I don't need to modify forth words! So convenient.
			But the screenbuffer does not have command line. 
	
		[ ] As shown below, 100 long works fine, but 100 long2's last line won't be shown until an enter
			will be pressed. Question is 'how to make printing stream a queue !!'
